          Day-use passes are required at some popular BC Parks during the summer and winter seasons. Reserving a pass 
          helps us manage the number of park visitors, so we can protect the park and you can have a better visiting 
          experience.

          There is no available first come, first served parking, so book ahead to avoid disappointment.
