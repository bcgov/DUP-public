          BC Parks requires that park users reserve a day-use pass during the summer and winter periods at select parks
          to help manage visitation levels at popular day use areas.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Visitors are required to reserve an AM, PM, or All-Day pass for their visit to the parks listed below, as
          these parks will have <span class="fw-bold">no</span> available first come, first served parking during the
          day. If no parks are currently listed, the day-use pass program is inactive.
