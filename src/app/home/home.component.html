        Nature is unpredictable; do your own research and pack the essentials -
        be prepared for anything.
      </li>
      <li>
        Share your plan with a friend. Let them know where you are going and
        when you expect to be back.
      </li>
      <li>

        in-park signage and have your pass accessible while in the park and on
        the trail.
