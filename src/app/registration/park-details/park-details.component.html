            As of June 22, 2021, visitors are required to reserve a day pass to visit participating parks. Depending on
            the park, a day-use pass may not be required for all trails. If the park is open and the trail or trailhead
            isn’t listed in the menu below, you do not need to reserve a day pass. Check the park webpage at
            <a href="http://www.bcparks.ca">www.bcparks.ca</a> for details on where you need a day-use pass.
        </p>
        <p>
            Passes are available to book starting at 7:00am, one day in advance of your planned visit. Once reserved,
            passes cannot be transferred to another date, time, or location and your pass cannot be shared beyond the
            group reserved. Please cancel according to the instructions in your confirmation email if the passes you’ve
            reserved are no longer needed.
        </p>
